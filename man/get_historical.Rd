\title{Obtain Historical BOM Data}
\usage{
get_historical(stationid = NULL, latlon = NULL, type = c("rain",
  "min", "max", "solar"), meta = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{stationid}{BOM station ID. See Details.}

\item{latlon}{Length-2 numeric vector of Latitude/Longitude. See Details.}

\item{type}{Measurement type, either daily "rain", "min" (temp), "max"
(temp), or "solar" (exposure). Partial matching is performed. If not
specified returns the first matching type in the order listed.}

\item{meta}{Logical switch to include metadata information on the station and
data from BOM. If set to TRUE a list is returned with a}
}
\value{
By default a complete \code{\link[base]{data.frame}} of historical
observations for the chosen station, with some subset of the following
columns

\tabular{rl}{
\strong{Product_code}:\tab BOM internal code.\cr
\strong{Station_number}:\tab BOM station ID.\cr
\strong{Year}:\tab Year of observation (YYYY).\cr
\strong{Month}:\tab Month of observation (1-12).\cr
\strong{Day}:\tab Day of observation (1-31).\cr
\strong{Min_temperature}:\tab Minimum daily recorded temperature (degrees C).\cr
\strong{Max_temperature}:\tab Maximum daily recorded temperature (degrees C).\cr
\strong{Accum_days_min}:\tab Accumulated number of days of minimum temperature.\cr
\strong{Accum_days_max}:\tab Accumulated number of days of maximum temperature.\cr
\strong{Rainfall}:\tab Daily recorded rainfall in mm.\cr
\strong{Period}:\tab Period over which rainfall was measured.\cr
\strong{Solar_exposure}:\tab Daily global solar exposure in MJ/m^2.\cr
\strong{Quality}:\tab Y, N, or missing. Data which have not yet completed the\cr
\tab routine quality control process are marked accordingly.
}

If \var{meta} is set \code{TRUE}, then a list is returned with an
additional \code{\link[base]{data.frame}} with the following columns
giving information on the station and data.

\tabular{rl}{
\strong{site}:\tab BOM station ID.\cr
\strong{name}:\tab BOM station name.\cr
\strong{lat}:\tab Latitude in decimal degrees.\cr
\strong{lon}:\tab Longitude in decimal degrees.\cr
\strong{start}:\tab Date observations start.\cr
\strong{end}:\tab Date observations end.\cr
\strong{years}:\tab Available number of years data.\cr
\strong{percent}:\tab Percent complete.\cr
\strong{AWS}:\tab Automated weather station?\cr
\strong{type}:\tab Measurement types available for the station.\cr
}

Temperature data prior to 1910 should be used with extreme caution as many
stations, prior to that date, were exposed in non-standard shelters, some
of which give readings which are several degrees warmer or cooler than
those measured according to post-1910 standards.

Daily maximum temperatures usually occur in the afternoon and daily minimum
temperatures overnight or near dawn. Occasionally, however, the lowest
temperature in the 24 hours to prior to 9 AM can occur around 9 AM the
previous day if the night was particularly warm.

Either \var{stationid} or \var{latlon} must be provided, but if both are,
then \var{stationid} will be used as it is more reliable.

In some cases data is available back to the 1800s, so tens of thousands of
daily records will be returned. Other stations will be newer and will
return fewer observations.
