# bomrang 0.4.0.9000

## Minor changes

- Updates documentation formatting and corrects minor issues

- Uses `curl` to download XML files before parsing them, rather than reading
directly from the server. `curl` gives more flexibility in handling the
server connections

- Uses `curl::curl_download()` in place of `utils::download.file()` for a
newer implementation of the same protocols

- Correct formatting of DESCRIPTION file to conform with CRAN guidelines

- Replaces `\dontrun{}` with `\donttest{}` for examples in documentation

- Spellcheck package and correct spelling where necessary

# bomrang 0.4.0

## Bug fixes

- `get_historical()` now fetches data for any station with historical data
available corrected an issue where previously it only fetched data for stations
that currently reported

- Enforce standardised output for `get_coastal_forecast()`. In some cases BOM
does not report all fields available, _bomrang_ will always report these with
`NA` if empty

## Minor changes

- Add new functionality to interact with and download radar imagery from BOM,
`get_available_radar()` and `get_radar_imagery()`

- When using `update_station_locations()` or `update_forecast_towns()` the user
is now prompted with a message about reproducibility before proceeding

- Update code of conduct statement in README to reflect that it only applies to
the `bomrang` project

- Update authors' list in vignette to include Dean Marchiori

- Add links to on-line versions of vignettes from README

- Standardise use of vocabulary in README

- Reorder vignette to have output from functions before maps

- Add maps of historical data completeness and availability to vignette,
Appendix 7

- Move copyright information from start-up message into CITATION file

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# bomrang 0.3.0

## Major changes

- Add new function `get_coastal_forecast()`, which fetches the BOM coastal
waters forecast

## Minor changes

- Add spaces between sentences in some error messages when interacting with the
BOM servers

- Enhance testing for `get_historical()`

- Handle checking multiple imagery files gracefully without returning warning
message if more than one file is to be loaded in current session

- Update citations for package to reflect current package and paper citation

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# bomrang 0.2.2

## Bug fixes

Fix corrupted zip file download issue for `get_historical()` on Windows

## Minor changes

- Update citations for package to reflect current package and paper citation

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# bomrang 0.2.1

## Minor changes

- Reduce R requirement back to >= 3.2.0 from 3.5.0

- Related to above, check for R version in `get_precis_forecast()` and adjust
field names according to the R version due to `tidyr`'s behaviour

- Clean up and reformat documentation, standardise references to packages,
links and author e-mail addresses

- Remove deprecated functions

## Bug fixes

- Correct field names in `get_precis_forecast()` where `maximum_temperature` and
`minimum_temperature` were reversed

- Move rappdirs to Suggests to fix NOTEs on
https://cran.rstudio.com/web/checks/check_results_bomrang.html

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# bomrang 0.2.0

## New features

- `get_historical()` retrieves historical daily rainfall, min/max temperatures,
or solar exposure. (@jonocarroll)

## Minor changes

precipitation data gracefully

## Bug fixes

- Add `rappdirs` to Imports section of DESCRIPTION file to fix missing import

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# bomrang 0.1.4

## Minor changes

- Much faster station location checking using `ASDS.foyer::latlon2SA`

- "BoM" is replaced with "BOM" throughout the package for consistency

- `janitor` >= 1.0.0 is now required

# bomrang 0.1.3

## Minor changes

- Much faster station location checking using `sf::st_join()`

## Bug fixes

- Correct issues with updating internal databases

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# bomrang 0.1.2

## Minor changes

- The internal `stations_site_list` now is checked against GADM 
(Global Administrative Areas), http://www.gadm.org/ to ensure state listed is
correct. This is in response to an error where Alice Springs Airport was
reported in South Australia in the March 2018 update from BOM. There may be
others. The original BOM values for state are in an `org_state` column.
However, `bomrang` will use the corrected `state` column values.

- Update code to be compliant with current and future versions of `janitor`

- Vignettes no longer evaluate code on-the-fly that requires BOM servers to
respond in response to CRAN rejecting `bomrang` for a failure of a vignette to
build due to this issue

## Bug fixes

- Correct issue with converting the timzeone in ag bulletin to character where
the conversion resulted in a vector of numerals, not the expected string of 
characters, e.g. "EST"

- Remove redundant functionality in `update_station_locations()` where data were
fetched using `tryCatch()` and then again without

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# bomrang 0.1.1

## Minor changes

- Correct comments for ORCID's in DESCRIPTION at the request of CRAN maintainers

- Update internal databases of metadata for station locations and URLs

- Add new hex-sticker image to README

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Enhanced documentation for the cached files in satellite imagery

- Update internal databases of metadata for station locations and URLs

## Bug fixes

- Fix issues with `get_precis_forecast()` and `get_ag_bulletin()` where they
failed to work properly. This fix lessens internal dependencies on _dplyr_ and
removes _rlang_ usage from package.

tidy data frame of the data

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# bomrang 0.0.5

## Bug Fixes

- Recommended `station_name` values are separated by spaces in
`get_current_weather()`

- Station names and location names are more consistent in the supplied data and
returned data frames.

- Lat/Lon values for `get_current_weather()` results are now reported using the
values from the internal database, which has a higher degree of accuracy. The
json file values are rounded while the values from the stations list has four
decimal places

## Major changes

- Fetch BOM satellite images available through public FTP

- New use-case vignette, using _bomrang_ for the _WINS_ project

- Welcome message included with statement regarding BOM copyright

- Concatenate vignettes into a single file with appendices for descriptions of
data returned by functions

- Product IDs are included in outputs from `get_*()` functions that return a
tidy dataframe

- Full station names are reported along with BOM's current name used to refer
to a station location. In some cases a station "name" may be the same for both
a current and retired station.

- Fuzzy matching is used for all functions now when user enters a value for a
desired state, station or the whole country for functions that require a `state`
argument

- Onload a message regarding the copyright and data source,
```r

```
is displayed

- the _bomrang_ vignette now contains instructions for use along with appendices
that document the data fields and units, rather than separate vignettes

- ramifications of updating station lists are now stated clearly in the vignette
and help files for applicable functions

- a map of BOM stations is included in an appendix of the _bomrang_ vignette

- Lat/Lon values are specified to be in decimal degrees in
`get_current_weather()` help and vignette

- Databases station locations and other metadata are internal an not exposed to
the user

- Use `file.path()` in place of `paste0()`

- The package has been linted,

    - line lengths are <80 chars,

    - best practice naming conventions are followed (where possible)

- Lint md files

- Spellchecking in all files

- `agrep` is now used in all functions where the user enters state or Australia
 values to query BOM data

- best practices for programming with `dplyr 0.7` using `rlang` are now
employed, which reduces the need for the `# CRAN NOTE avoidance`

- "JSONurl_latlon_by_station_name" has been shortened to
"JSONurl_site_list".

- The DESCRIPTION file now states minimum package versions for packages that are
undergoing rapid development

- Code has been re-factored to be shorter, _e.g._, `xml_bulletin_url` in
`get_ag_bulletion()`

- `.get_obs()` has been moved out of the `.parse_bulletin()` function for easier
reading/maintenance

- fixed a repeat of `return(tidy_df)` in `get_precis_forecast()`
